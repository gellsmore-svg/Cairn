## [Unreleased] — 2026-07-09

- Added browser-driven UI evidence tooling for human-load analysis:
  - `cairn-ui-sim` scenarios can collect `measureLayout` snapshots from Playwright.
  - `cairn-ui-evidence` and `cairn-ui-pipeline` turn simulation reports into
    HCI phase evidence, human-factor findings, qualitative risk, and Cairn
    annotation snippets.
  - Layout overlay exports now support single snapshots, selected snapshot
    indices, bulk numbered SVG exports, Markdown indexes, and JSON manifests.
- Added functional layout-load analysis for UI geometry:
  - `cairn-layout-load` estimates label/control distance, related-element
    distance, evidence-to-action distance, columns, scan path, pointer travel,
    and recovery load.
  - Reports include suggested `FUNCTIONAL_LAYOUT_LOAD` Cairn blocks and SVG
    overlays for visual review.
- Expanded package and manifest surfaces so deterministic UI evidence and
  layout-load analyzers are discoverable from Python and Keturah-compatible
  tooling.
- Removed the hard runtime dependency on Keturah. Cairn now uses Keturah when it
  is installed and otherwise provides a small compatible manifest representation,
  keeping `pip install cairn-lang` dependency-light.
- Added the OKF Augmentation Process lens for human-AI collaboration:
  cognitive-state adaptation, role complementarity, shared mental models,
  interaction richness, trust calibration, and automation-bias risk.
- Extended HCI touchpoints, functional layout load, and the offline
  human-factors analyzer with augmentation-specific cues and review questions.
- Added usage-mode documentation and a Cairn-described manual agent analysis
  orchestration pattern for GitHub-link/process-file analysis.
- Added interactionless hosted LLM wrappers for Grok/xAI, Claude/Anthropic,
  OpenAI-compatible endpoints, and Gemini.
- Added OKF-traceable interface recommendation generation and report assembly
  (`cairn-recommend-interface-changes`, `cairn-generate-report`).
- Added a future usage logging and touchpoint analytics specification, with
  explicit guidance to keep production telemetry outside Cairn core unless it
  becomes a portable semantic contract.
- Clarified that manual interactive agent analysis can and should invoke Cairn
  Python APIs and CLI tools when the harness can execute local code.
- Added an agent harness playbook with a concrete CLI and Python sequence for
  tool-assisted manual Cairn analysis.
- Added `cairn-agent-harness-plan` and `build_agent_harness_plan` so interactive
  agents can ask Cairn which deterministic commands fit the available evidence.
- Added shell-script formatting for agent harness plans.
- Added harness-plan input provenance, repository/screenshot inputs, optional
  local file checks, and shell preflight guards for supplied evidence.
- Added `--fail-on-missing` for agent harness plans so unattended callers can
  write a plan and still fail fast on missing local evidence.
- Made `--fail-on-missing` imply local input checking for agent harness plans.

  'cairn' is an unrelated project occupying 0.1.0–0.2.3, and once won a
  find-links + index resolve. 0.3.0 also dodges its version range.

  including identity, parent revision, status, trigger information, and a complete
  bounded `PROCESS` backbone on every revision.

## [0.8] — 2026-06-16

From feedback after modelling an end-to-end human-led, AI-assisted delivery
process (customer idea → frame → build → verify → release → change management):

- **Render profiles (§3).** The "two styles" generalise to audience profiles —
  one canonical backbone *projected* into `ai` (precise), `operator` (guided
  operational narrative), `executive` (overview), and `audit` (defensible record).
  Profiles are rendered by tooling/AI, not hand-authored. `render-profile:` selects
  one. The **operator profile** is specified in full (Purpose / Owner / Assisted-by
  / Outputs / Iterate-until / Next, with compression rules + a "don't over-compress"
  guardrail).
- **Ownership vs. contribution (§7).** The `Actor` dimension is the *accountable
  owner*; `ASSISTED-BY: <actors>` names who materially contributes — e.g.
  `[HUMAN, ASSISTED-BY: LLM]`. Owners may carry a role (`[HUMAN: Product Lead]`).
  Hybrid human-led / AI-assisted work no longer disappears at the top level.
- **`MILESTONE` and `PURPOSE`** constructs — major transitions and per-phase intent,
  the signals the human-facing profiles render.

## [0.7] — 2026-06-16

First **stress-tested release**: the v0.6 draft plus everything learned from
describing three real systems (Tirzah, Hoglah, Mahalath) in Cairn. Adds a
structural grammar ([GRAMMAR.md](GRAMMAR.md)).

**Renamed** from the working title "APML" to **Cairn** — a cairn marks a route
with simple waypoints so anyone who follows can stay on the path, which is what a
Cairn description does for humans and AI.

Revision following design review. Adds:

- **Three document modes** — CONTEXT (scene), REQUIREMENTS/OUTCOMES (testable
  assertions), PROCESS (flow) — kept distinct.
- **Shared backbone + dual styles.** Formal and Narrative are two renderings of
  one canonical structure (numbering + constructs + tags + state); an AI keeps
  them in sync. Formal is canonical for machine semantics.
- **Scoped, referenced STATE.** Inline directional declarations
  (`scope`/`dir`/`ref`) linked by number to a definitive STATE REFERENCE.
- **Progressive-formality construct modifiers** with defaults (ITERATE
  `UNTIL/MAX`, RECURSE `BASE/MAX_DEPTH`, QUEUE `ORDER`, PARALLEL `STATE/MERGE`,
  RETRY `MAX/BACKOFF`, ERROR propagation).
- **Tags as orthogonal dimensions** (Actor / Determinism / Timing / Effects /
  Control) + namespaced extensions; vocabulary grows from real use.
- **Requirements & Outcomes mode** — `R#` SHALL/SHOULD assertions with
  `ACCEPTANCE`, `[MUST/SHOULD/MAY]`, and `[SATISFIES: R#]` traceability.
- **Composition** — PROCESS signatures (INPUT/OUTPUT) + `CALL`.
- **Structural conformance** rules + a worked example in both styles.

Refinements from the first stress test (Tirzah, `examples/tirzah.cairn.md`):

- **`BREAK` / `CONTINUE`** loop control + `ITERATE UNTIL` may read body-set state
  (explicit loop exit instead of a DECISION "falling out").
- **Fan-out clarified** — a step may make many like calls (`[BATCH]`) and still be
  one step; `PARALLEL` is reserved for concurrent independent branches.
- **`ERROR THEN: fallback → <target>`** names the concrete recovery.
- **STATE scope semantics** spelled out (§6.4); `iteration` scope resets each round.
- **STATE across `CALL`** is private by default (§6.5) — data crosses via
  INPUT/OUTPUT; shared mutable state must be declared at a shared scope.

Refinements from stress tests 2–3 (Hoglah, Mahalath):

- **`SERVICE` + `CONCURRENT`** — long-running concurrent activities that never
  join (worker loops, consumers, watched folders), distinct from `PARALLEL`
  (which joins at MERGE).
- **`AWAIT [EVENT/TIMEOUT/THEN]`** — suspend until a human/system event; real
  processes wait (the `[GATED, HUMAN]` and broker-ack cases).
- **`ATOMIC` / `DURABLE-BEFORE` / `RECOVERY:`** — express safety-critical ordering
  between steps and what happens if a crash lands between them (the crash-window
  analogue of `ERROR` fallback).
- **`RECURSE` is a self-`CALL`** — clarified, so recursion isn't double-notated.
- **`DECISION` branch bodies** — multi-step branches nest with letters (`2a.`/`2b.`),
  like PARALLEL.
- **`IDEMPOTENT [KEY: …]`** + parameterised tags (`BATCH [n]`).
- **Emergent guarantees** — `[SATISFIES]` may name several steps across processes;
  `[MAY]` = capability, so `[SATISFIES]` on it means "supports", not "guarantees".

## [0.5] — prior

Initial prototype: PROCESS / numbered hierarchy / core verbs / tags / constructs
(ITERATE, RECURSE, QUEUE, PARALLEL, DECISION, RETRY, ERROR, STATE UPDATE, OUTPUT,
RISKS), CONSTRAINTS/BOUNDARIES and CONTEXT blocks, Formal + Narrative styles.
